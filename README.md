INFORMATION
======
This project is basically dead (2 years since last commit) and I do not even recommend using the "structure" as a base it's old it's dusty it's disgusting so please do not fork this >.>

SAMPAC
======

A Plug-in based SA:MP Anticheat.

Still in development people! Fork and pull out them requests!

ThemAC-XP.vcxproj includes the VS stuff for the plugin to work for XP users.
It will be used in the release, but just ignore this file unless you want to compile as an XP user.
